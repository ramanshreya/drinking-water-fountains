# Mapping Ancient Drinking Water Basins In Granada, Spain

This project uses manually collected data on <i>pilares</i> or ancient drinking water basins in the Spanish city of Granada.

These pilares were built as early as 14th century and a lot of them are well maintained and provide clean and cold drinking water. The primary purpose of this project was to create a geospatial database on these historically significant landmarks and to provide as a guide for tourists visiting the city.

This project is also my first attempt at creating a concrete mapping project told through "scrollytelling". The final project can be found [here](https://ramanshreya.github.io/drinking-water-fountains/)

## The Process

The data for this project was collated by walking around the city and geotagging the location using the list function of google maps. The data was then exported and cleaned. The process for cleaning the data is in the ```Drinking water fountain.ipynb```.

The base map was made on Datawrapper and then exported as an svg. This was then edited on illustrator and was exported as html code using [ai2html](http://ai2html.org/).

The elements that needed to change with scrollytelling where exported as svgs within the code and this code was used to hide and show the elements. I used scrollama to implement scrollytelling.
